/**
 * Let the camera get close to the handheld captures.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. Walk up to the alumni statues and they start being sliced away
 * by an invisible plane a few metres in front of the camera. The same thing
 * happens in Scene Viewer on ArcGIS Online, which is the clue: it is not this
 * app, it is the renderer's near clipping plane, and it is deliberate.
 *
 * WHY IT HAPPENS. Depth is stored per pixel with finite precision, and how much
 * of that precision you get depends almost entirely on the ratio between the
 * far and the near plane, not on their absolute values. Push near towards zero
 * while far is at the horizon and the ratio explodes; surfaces a few
 * centimetres apart then round to the same depth value and flicker against each
 * other. So the SDK does not choose near freely. Measured in this scene, with
 * `clipDistance.mode` on its default "auto":
 *
 *     camera 2000 m out    near 10.2744    far 205488    far/near 2.0e+4
 *     camera  500 m out    near 10.2952    far 205904    far/near 2.0e+4
 *     camera  120 m out    near 10.3005    far 206009    far/near 2.0e+4
 *
 * near barely moves as the camera closes in, and the ratio is pinned to exactly
 * 20000. The far plane is what is being chosen - it has to reach the horizon,
 * so it sits around 206 km - and near is then simply far / 20000. That lands it
 * a little over 10 m out. Anything nearer is not drawn, which is precisely the
 * reported symptom.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES. It keeps the renderer's precision budget and spends it
 * differently: close to the ground it pulls both planes towards the camera
 * together, holding the same far:near ratio. At eye height near becomes about
 * 12 cm and far about 6 km, so the statue in front of you is drawn and what is
 * given up is scenery kilometres away.
 *
 * The renderer's own choice is the ceiling, so there is no threshold to cross.
 * Above roughly 120 m the two agree and the planes are handed back to "auto" -
 * every slide in the tour is well above that and is untouched.
 *
 * WHY ALTITUDE, AND NOT WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT. The first version measured the
 * distance to `view.center`, the point under the middle of the screen, which
 * reads better on paper: it is the thing you are trying to inspect. It also
 * made the zoom judder, and the reason is worth writing down. `view.center` is
 * obtained by hit-testing the drawn scene. Moving the clip planes changes what
 * is drawn, which changes `view.center`, which moves the clip planes - a loop,
 * running once per frame, engaging at exactly the distance where the trouble
 * was reported. Camera altitude is an input to rendering and never an output of
 * it, so it cannot feed back. Everything here worth walking up to stands on the
 * plaza anyway.
 *
 * Two further things keep it quiet. The near plane is quantised to octaves, so
 * it is rewritten only when it doubles or halves rather than on every frame of
 * a zoom; and the handover back to "auto" has hysteresis, so sitting near the
 * boundary cannot flip the far plane between 6 km and 206 km on alternate
 * frames.
 *
 * THE OTHER THING IN THE WAY, WHICH THIS CANNOT FIX. Clip planes are only half
 * of it. The SDK also clamps how near an interactive zoom may bring the camera
 * to the point it is zooming at - `minimumPoiDistance`, which the zoom handler
 * passes straight into its step function. Measured on this build it is a flat
 * 4 m, and it does not move:
 *
 *     near plane   8 m   4 m   1 m   0.25 m   0.0625 m
 *     min POI      4 m   4 m   4 m   4 m      4 m
 *
 * So it is not derived from the clip planes, and writing to it is ignored - it
 * is internal state, not part of `SceneViewConstraints`. Zoom towards a statue
 * and the camera stops four metres short while the wheel keeps asking for more:
 * momentum against a hard stop, which reads as the view fighting back rather
 * than as a limit. The way past it is not to zoom: `goTo` is not clamped, so a
 * scripted approach can put the camera where the wheel will not.
 *
 * Add `?clipdebug` to the URL for a live readout of all of it.
